# Obedai Project Status & To-Do List

This document outlines the current status of the Obedai Resume Builder application, including pending fixes, areas for polish, and potential future enhancements to make the app production-ready.

## âœ… Recently Completed

### 1. Robust Favicon Implementation
-   **Action:** Implemented a more robust favicon implementation in `index.html` using multiple `<link>` tags (`shortcut icon`, `apple-touch-icon`) and corrected the document's character set to `UTF-8` to maximize cross-browser compatibility.
-   **Reasoning:** This addresses issues where the app icon was not displaying reliably by providing multiple formats that different browsers and devices expect.

### 2. Rich Text Editing Polish
-   **Action:** Refactored rich text fields (`Summary`, `Cover Letter`) to automatically clean and normalize their HTML output on blur. This replaces deprecated tags (like `<b>` and `<font>`) with modern equivalents (`<strong>` and styled `<span>`s).
-   **Reasoning:** This ensures more consistent and reliable formatting across different browsers, fixing a key limitation of the browser's native `contentEditable` functionality.

### 3. Clarified AI Template Creation Status
-   **Action:** Added a "Beta" label to the "Create with AI" feature in both the template switcher button and the upload modal.
-   **Reasoning:** This manages user expectations, clarifying that the feature is advanced and experimental, and its results may vary in accuracy depending on the input image quality and design complexity.

### 4. Implemented Granular Error Handling
-   **Action:** Refactored the AI service to throw specific error types (e.g., `NetworkError`, `APIError`). The UI now catches these errors and displays more user-friendly and context-specific messages.
-   **Reasoning:** This significantly improves the user experience by providing clearer feedback when something goes wrong, helping the user understand the problem and what to do next.

## ðŸŸ¡ Features Requiring Polish

These features are functional but could be improved for a better user experience and more robust performance.

### 1. PDF Generation Quality
-   **Current Status:** The app uses the `html2canvas` library to capture an image of the resume preview and convert it to a PDF.
-   **Limitation:** This method can sometimes result in slightly lower text quality or minor layout shifts compared to the on-screen preview. Text is not selectable in the final PDF.
-   **Next Step:** For perfect, vector-based PDFs with selectable text, the rendering logic could be reimplemented using the `jsPDF` library's direct drawing commands (`doc.text()`, `doc.rect()`, etc.). This is a significant undertaking but would produce professional-grade results.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements for Production

These are larger features and architectural improvements to consider before a full public launch.

-   **Comprehensive Accessibility (A11y) Audit:** While ARIA attributes are used, a full audit should be performed to ensure the app is usable for everyone, including those with screen readers.
-   **Automated Testing:** Implementing a testing suite (e.g., using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end tests) is crucial for long-term stability and confident feature development.
-   **User Accounts & Database:** To allow users to save, manage, and revisit their resumes and cover letters, a backend with a database and user authentication system would be required.
-   **Advanced State Management:** For an application of this scale, migrating from `useState` in the root component to a dedicated state management library (like Zustand or Redux Toolkit) could improve performance and make the codebase easier to maintain as it grows.
